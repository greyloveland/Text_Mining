# Text Mining Project Example

## Description

This project demonstrates a full text mining workflow using natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised machine learning. The app allows users to clean, cluster, and summarize raw text documents through a simple, interactive Streamlit interface.

Itâ€™s designed to show how text data can be transformed into meaningful groupings and summarized insights using modern NLP tools and machine learning techniques.
